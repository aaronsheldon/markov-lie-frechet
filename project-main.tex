	% Abstract
	\altchapter{\bf{Abstract}}
	Continuous time Markov processes and Lie algebras have individually been 
	highly productive fields of investigation for more than a century; however, 
	the two fields remain ripe for cross pollination. In particular the 
	application of results from Lie algebra theory will fruitfully yield novel 
	computational methods for estimation problems in continuous time Markov 
	processes. In this project we derive the minimal Lie algebra that contains the
	generators of a continuous time Markov process, and then using the guarantees 
	of algebraic closure construct a Newton-Raphson algorithm for maximum 
	likelihood estimation of the generator of a continuous time Markov process 
	from stopped random variables using P\'ade approximations for Taylor series
	expressions of the first and second order derivatives of the exponential map.
