	\altchapter{\bf{Abstract}}
	The probability theory of stochastic processes and Lie theory have 
	individually been highly productive fields of investigation for more than a 
	century; yet they remain ripe for cross pollination. In particular, the 
	application of algebraic and analytic results from Lie theory can yield novel 
	computational methods for the estimation of generators of continuous time 
	homogeneous Markov processes on finite state spaces. In this project we derive 
	the minimal Lie algebra that contains the generators of continuous time 
	homogeneous Markov processes on finite state spaces, and then using the 
	guarantees of algebraic and analytic closure construct a Newton-Raphson 
	algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the generator of a continuous 
	time homogeneous Markov process on a finite state space from stopped random 
	variables using P\'ade approximations for Taylor series expressions of the 
	first and second order derivatives of the exponential map.

	\altchapter{\bf{Acknowledgements}}
	First and foremost is my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor who has had the 
	extraordinary patience to survive the many years of rumination it took for me 
	to develop these meager ideas.
	
	Second, and no less important, my loving family, who withstood the long 
	stretches of my physical presence, but mental absence while I developed, and 
	explored the mathematical geography I describe in this report.
