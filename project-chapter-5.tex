\section{Discussion}
Application of Lie Theory to the embedding problem for first hitting times...
Differentiate between problem of choosing a branch of the matrix logarithm
and multiple Markov models having the same first hitting time distribution.
Once a principle branch of the logarithm is fixed stochastic Lie algebra can 
give meaning to the idea of a simplest model, the one expressed in the fewest 
canonical generators.
