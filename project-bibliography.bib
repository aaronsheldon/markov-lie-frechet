	abstract = {An authorised reissue of the long out of print classic textbook, Advanced Calculus by the late Dr Lynn Loomis and Dr Shlomo Sternberg both of Harvard University has been a revered but hard to find textbook for the advanced calculus course for decades.  This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that the authors gave in the 1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more material than was covered in any one year. It can accordingly be used (with omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a three-semester introduction to analysis.  The prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. As possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R Courant, Calculus by T Apostol, Calculus by M Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by G Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives.  In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds. Readership: Undergraduates in mathematics.},

	abstract = {The scaling and squaring method for the matrix exponential is based on the approximation \$e{\textasciicircum}A {\textbackslash}approx (r\_m(2{\textasciicircum}\{-s\}A)){\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}s\}\$, where \$r\_m(x)\$ is the \$[m/m]\$ Padé approximant to \$e{\textasciicircum}x\$ and the integers m and s are to be chosen. Several authors have identified a weakness of existing scaling and squaring algorithms termed overscaling, in which a value of s much larger than necessary is chosen, causing a loss of accuracy in floating point arithmetic. Building on the scaling and squaring algorithm of Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 26 (2005), pp. 1179–1193], which is used by the MATLAB function expm, we derive a new algorithm that alleviates the overscaling problem. Two key ideas are employed. The first, specific to triangular matrices, is to compute the diagonal elements in the squaring phase as exponentials instead of from powers of \$r\_m\$. The second idea is to base the backward error analysis that underlies the algorithm on members of the sequence \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\}{\textbackslash}\}\$ instead of \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$, since for nonnormal matrices it is possible that \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\}\$ is much smaller than \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$, and indeed this is likely when overscaling occurs in existing algorithms. The terms \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\}\$ are estimated without computing powers of A by using a matrix 1-norm estimator in conjunction with a bound of the form \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\} {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}max{\textbackslash}bigl( {\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}p{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/p\}, {\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}q{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/q\} {\textbackslash}bigr)\$ that holds for certain fixed p and q less than k. The improvements to the truncation error bounds have to be balanced by the potential for a large \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ to cause inaccurate evaluation of \$r\_m\$ in floating point arithmetic. We employ rigorous error bounds along with some heuristics to ensure that rounding errors are kept under control. Our numerical experiments show that the new algorithm generally provides accuracy at least as good as the existing algorithm of Higham at no higher cost, while for matrices that are triangular or cause overscaling it usually yields significant improvements in accuracy, cost, or both.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm is developed for computing \$e{\textasciicircum}\{tA\}B\$, where A is an \$n{\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix and B is \$n{\textbackslash}times n\_0\$ with \$n\_0 {\textbackslash}ll n\$. The algorithm works for any A, its computational cost is dominated by the formation of products of A with \$n{\textbackslash}times n\_0\$ matrices, and the only input parameter is a backward error tolerance. The algorithm can return a single matrix \$e{\textasciicircum}\{tA\}B\$ or a sequence \$e{\textasciicircum}\{t\_kA\}B\$ on an equally spaced grid of points \$t\_k\$. It uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential. It determines the amount of scaling and the Taylor degree using the recent analysis of Al-Mohy and Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 31 (2009), pp. 970–989], which provides sharp truncation error bounds expressed in terms of the quantities \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\}\$ for a few values of k, where the norms are estimated using a matrix norm estimator. Shifting and balancing are used as preprocessing steps to reduce the cost of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm performs in a numerically stable fashion across a wide range of problems, and analysis of rounding errors and of the conditioning of the problem provides theoretical support. Experimental comparisons with MATLAB codes based on Krylov subspace, Chebyshev polynomial, and Laguerre polynomial methods show the new algorithm to be sometimes much superior in terms of computational cost and accuracy. An important application of the algorithm is to exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the sums of the form \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{k=0\}{\textasciicircum}p {\textbackslash}varphi\_k(A)u\_k\$ that arise in exponential integrators, where the \${\textbackslash}varphi\_k\$ are related to the exponential function, can be expressed in terms of a single exponential of a matrix of dimension \$n+p\$ built by augmenting A with additional rows and columns, and the algorithm of this paper can therefore be employed.},

	abstract = {The matrix exponential is a much-studied matrix function having many applications. The Fréchet derivative of the matrix exponential describes the first-order sensitivity of \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$ to perturbations in A and its norm determines a condition number for \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$. Among the numerous methods for computing \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$ the scaling and squaring method is the most widely used. We show that the implementation of the method in [N. J. Higham, The scaling and squaring method for the matrix exponential revisited, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 26 (2005), pp. 1179–1193] can be extended to compute both \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$ and the Fréchet derivative at A in the direction E, denoted by \$L(A,E)\$, at a cost about three times that for computing \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$ alone. The algorithm is derived from the scaling and squaring method by differentiating the Padé approximants and the squaring recurrence, reusing quantities computed during the evaluation of the Padé approximant, and intertwining the recurrences in the squaring phase. To guide the choice of algorithmic parameters, an extension of the existing backward error analysis for the scaling and squaring method is developed which shows that, modulo rounding errors, the approximations obtained are \$e{\textasciicircum}\{A+{\textbackslash}Delta A\}\$ and \$L(A+{\textbackslash}Delta A,E+{\textbackslash}Delta E)\$, with the same \${\textbackslash}Delta A\$ in both cases, and with computable bounds on \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta A{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ and \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta E{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$. The algorithm for \$L(A,E)\$ is used to develop an algorithm that computes \$e{\textasciicircum}A\$ together with an estimate of its condition number. In addition to results specific to the exponential, we develop some results and techniques for arbitrary functions. We show how a matrix iteration for \$f(A)\$ yields an iteration for the Fréchet derivative and show how to efficiently compute the Fréchet derivative of a power series. We also show that a matrix polynomial and its Fréchet derivative can be evaluated at a cost at most three times that of computing the polynomial itself and give a general framework for evaluating a matrix function and its Fréchet derivative via Padé approximation.},

Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37\% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Padé approximation to the function \$x {\textbackslash}coth(x)\$. This method is found to be essentially a variation of the standard one with weaker supporting error analysis.},
