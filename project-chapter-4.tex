\chapter{Maximum Likelihood Estimation from First Hitting Times}
\section{Distribution of First Hitting Times}
%With total knowledge of all first hits p_ij=N_ij/T_ij
%Prove its a stopped process where we take the product with the projection onto 
%all the other transitative states. Essentially zero out the rows of the states
%we observe first hitting on, turn them into absorbing states
% Introduce simple linear parameterization of the vector space of the algebra
\section{The Likelihood and Its Maximization}
%Long formula basically
\section{Newton-Raphson Maximization}
\subsection{Formulation}
\subsection{Algorithm}
%SIMD map-reduce version of looping through the observations
