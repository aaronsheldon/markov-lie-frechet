# markov-lie-frechet

This repository will contain the work of a Master project in statistics.

## Work to incorporate

* Background and motivation: Hidden Markov Models versus stopping time problems; such as finite birth-death processes, and phase type distributions (maybe mention latest PNAS article on accelerated failure time models in C. Elegans, to contrast with mainstay of proportional hazard models being used)
* Abstract definition of the Lie group of invertible stochastic linear maps
* Computation of strucutre coefficients of the generators of the Lie algebra of stochastic linear maps
* Representations of the Frechet derivative of the exponential map
* Pade approximation of the Frechet derivative ofthe exponential map and Kroenecker product expansion of the adjoint
* Representations of the second Frechet derivative of the exponential map
* Multivariable Pade approximation of the second Frechet derivative of the exponential map
* Construction of a Newton-Raphson method for maximum likelihood estimation of the generator of a continuous Markov process
* Application to survival data in continuing care settings
